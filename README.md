Project introduction: 

The primary objective of this project is to comprehensively assess sales performance over different periods and across various 
regions, including country, state, and city. This involves identifying the top-selling products and categories to highlight 
customer preferences and market demand. Additionally, the analysis will examine sales trends over time to uncover patterns and 
fluctuations in sales performance. By evaluating the impact of different campaign schemas on sales, the project aims to 
determine the effectiveness of marketing strategies and their influence on customer purchasing behavior. This multi-faceted 
approach will provide valuable insights into regional and temporal sales dynamics, aiding data-driven decision-making and 
strategic planning.
